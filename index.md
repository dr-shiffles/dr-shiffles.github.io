# Hello! My name is Shifat :)

I am a Design Engineer in the Automotive Industry, since 2019. I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wayne State University in 2019, and I cam currently working towards Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Michigan-Dearborn. Fun facts about me: I fly airplanes for fun (well, learning to do so anyway). I'm fluent in English, Japanese and Bengali; I'm probably more "Mr. Worldwide" than Pitbull.

Welcome to my website, which I will be using as an online resume and also a place to share the things I create.
