# Hello! My name is Shifat :)

I am a Design Engineer in the Automotive Industry, since 2019. I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wayne State University in 2019, and I am currently working towards Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Michigan-Dearborn. Fun facts about me: I fly airplanes for fun (well, learning to do so anyway). I'm fluent in English, Japanese and Bengali; I'm probably more "Mr. Worldwide" than Pitbull. Welcome to my website! 

# My projects

### Shifat's Engineering Notes
Taking [Aerostudents](http://www.aerostudents.com/) as an inspiration, I have decided to clean up and type up my notes from my various engineering courses that I have taken during my studies. They are being created and will be updating soon. Please not some of them are courses that I have yet to take, but I plan on making notes for them. 

### PotatoEngineer - YouTube Channel
I run a YouTube Channel where I share my drone footage, travel videos, and namely my gameplay videos of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. I am part of the RaidForceOne group, a discord community of flgiht simmers, and often have group flights.
