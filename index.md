# Hello! My name is Shifat :)

I am a Design Engineer in the Automotive Industry, since 2019. I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wayne State University in 2019, and I cam currently working towards Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Michigan-Dearborn. 

Welcome to my website, which I will be using as an online resume and also a place to share the things I create. 

# My projects

## Shifat's Controls Notes
I am working towards typing up my notes from my various Control System classes that I took during my studies. They are being created and will be updating soon.

## PotatoEngineer - YouTube Channel
I run a YouTube channel mostly consisting of Microsoft Flight Simulator gameplay videos, and drone footage. I decided to start the channel during the COVID-19 pandemic to share my group flight sessions with RaidForceOne in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, as well as to share my drone videos and various travel-related videos that I make.
