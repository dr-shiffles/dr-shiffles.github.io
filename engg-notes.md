# Shifat's Engineering Notes
Taking [Aerostudents](http://www.aerostudents.com/) as an inspiration, I have decided to clean up and type up my notes from my various engineering courses that I have taken during my studies. They are being created and will be updating soon. Please not some of them are courses that I have yet to take, but I plan on making notes for them.
